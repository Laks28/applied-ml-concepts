# Problem Statement 

Predict house prices based on their size using a simple linear model

Given data points representing the house sizes (x) and their corresponding prices (y)

\[
f_{w,b}(x) = w \times x + b
\]


where 
- `w` is weight (slope)
- `b` is the bias (intercept)
- `f_wb(x)` gives the predicted price 

### Objective
- Implement the hypothesis function from scratch
- Choose sample values for `w` and `b`
- Generate predicted prices for gives house sizes
- Plot the original data and fitted line
- Understad how `w` and `b` affect the line

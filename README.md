# ðŸ§  Applied ML Concepts  

A collection of **practical machine learning implementations built from scratch**.  

This repository documents my hands-on journey through **Supervised Machine Learning fundamentals**, with each concept designed as a small, self-contained project.  
Each module includes:  
- A clear problem statement  
- Step-by-step implementation  
- Visualizations and analysis of results  

Every folder represents one concept or topic in ML, explained through **code + visualization + notes**.  
Each module has a dedicated `problem_statement.md` describing the goal, dataset, and assumptions.

Each numbered folder focuses on a specific concept, allowing incremental understanding and practical exploration.
